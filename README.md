# Common-Algorithms-and-Problems


Important notice - As of April 2024 I am deprecating this repository in favour of separate repos for each language with more robust examples and explanations.

This repo will remain live until I have ported out all existing implementations into their updated repositories, at which time I will phase out this repo.


This repo will contain commonly requested algorithms and coding problems for coding interviews.

I will be using this as an opportunity to practice my own implementation skills and to improve my coding ability.
I hope that others may utilise the code to aid with their own understanding.

All code will be fully commented to aid with this educational task.
I intend on producing multiple implementations for each algorithm/ concept in different languages over time.

The table below is a reflection of what is currently implemented and in which languages.

| Category | Algorithm/ Concept | Languages implemented |

| Sorting | Selection sort | C, Python, Java, Kotlin, Scala |
| Searching | Linear search | C, Python, Java, Kotlin, Go, Scala |
